# taskCollabera

For this task I will assume that we are creating service that subscribes to some message broker (e.g. kafka)
than it processes data, store it and provide some API to query the data it stores (get price by instrumentName)

Assumptions:
  1) I will assume that price feed data is being created in some distributed system, and that ID is generated by some
  Sequencer that support ordering. So that if price1.id < price2.id  => price2 is newer data point then price1
  (we can also use timestamp to sort data. However, synchronizing time across distributed system is daunting task)

The amount of data we need to store in our service is no more than n * (n - 1 )  , where n is number of currencies.
we can easily store this amount of data in RAM. Persistent storages can be considered only for durability reasons.

Depending on purpose of this service, instead of providing API for querying, we could push updated data back to
message broker (e.g kafka streams approach) and then consumers could subscribe to this topic of data.
